This is a repo for an assignment given by Tentworks.
If I had to redo it, I probably won't do a local multiplayer.
With limited time, The code might not be very clean, The Plate module isn't yet functioning, nor will customer get angry.
I do like a basic artwork to work with, otherwise even prototypes look lifeless and not fun.
