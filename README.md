# CookingMaster
This is a repo for an assignment given by Tentworks.
If I had to redo it, I probably won't do a local multiplayer.
With limited time, The code might not be very clean, The Plate module isn't yet functioning, nor will customer get angry.
I do like a basic artwork to work with, otherwise even prototypes look lifeless and not fun.

Leaderboard makes no sense as well. However if I was continuing the project, would swap Images for 3d models at counter for fruits. Would add a system to make customer angry which was in the document but remove local multiplayer element, would make it similar to a SinglePlayer Farmville game or other older web based games with neighbor interactions.
